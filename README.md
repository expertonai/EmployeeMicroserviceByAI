# Summary of Simple Employee Microservice developed 100% with AI

## We developed 5 REST APIs with AI to performed all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations

1. POST API to create an employee
2. GET API to fetch all the employees
3. GET API to fetch a single employee with id
4. PATCH API to edit a single employee data fields
5. DELETE API to delete an employee from the database
6. We implemented proper data validation and error handling using AI

## We added 2 New Features using AI

1. Added API Version (“v1”) in the path for all APIs, example “/api/v1/employees/”
2. Added Sorting ("sort=asc|desc") via querystring to Get All Employee API based on their Salary

## We Fixed 2 Defects using AI

1. Fixed the Date of Joining Defects
2. Fixed the 400 (Bad Request) Format Defects
